Switch off the lights
And close your eyes
Feel the energy inside
Chillibow, chillibow, chillibow

Fire!
Fire!

Alright! Sharpen the mix, get the pressure
You've had the time to rest
Which is coming to an end
And we start again

Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody

One, two, three
Fire!
Hey, hey, hey

Sharpen the mix, do all kind of tricks
Up to the pressure, feeling the kicks
You love the sound, we need you to go
Up and down, chillibow, chillibow

Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody

One, two, three
Fire!
Hey, hey, hey

Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency

Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency
The radical M.C.H.P's got the melody

Back to the, back to the, back to the, back to the
Back, back, back, back, back, back
